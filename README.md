# instagram-clone

instagram-clone was built for the purpose of expanding my skills in backend develeopment and cloud technologies. I've implemented some, but not all, of the core features provided provided by Instagram.

The code for local version of the project can be found at: [/Server/src](https://github.com/austinburnett/webapp-backend/tree/master/Server/src).
Which includes the following features:
- Authentication/Authorization with JWT
- Rest Api with CRUD database operations
- Docker development environment
- Continuous Integration(CI) with AWS CodeBuild triggered by pushing commits to the repo
- Postman Api testing workspace
- Unit tests using jest testing framework

## Overview of Documentation
- Instructions on running the project locally: [/Server/README.md](https://github.com/austinburnett/webapp-backend/blob/master/Server/README.md)
